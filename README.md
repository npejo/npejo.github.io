## Build version of my blog

It took me few days to develop it, but it was in the background of my thoughts for more than a year.

I wanted to build a website without any image in the structure and that will be generate randomly, so it will surprise even me when I visit it.

After few tries, I found that complete randomness is equal to chaos and doesn't look good most of the time.

So I set the background blocks in matrix to keep them in order, defined few appearance animations and color themes and let the Javascript to choose one of them.

It is generated by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.
