My name is **Nikola Pejoski**,
I'm full stack web developer with more than 7 years of experience.
In the last 3 years I have specialized in frontend technologies. 

I feel like home when I'm writing Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML and SQL.

In general, my professional interests include software architecture and design, performance optimization.

I like to write software that looks good from both perspectives, for the users and for other developers.
