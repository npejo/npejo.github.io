My name is **Nikola Pejoski**,
I'm full-stack web developer with more than 7 years of experience. 
In this period I have worked with various programming languages, frameworks and tools. 
I have developed small and mid-size projects starting from scratch, also I have worked as part of distributed team on large scale platform. 
Last 3 years I have specialized in front-end technologies.

I like to write software that looks good from both perspectives, for the users and for other developers.
In general, the fields in which I like to extend my professional knowledge are software architecture and design, performance optimization and data analysis.
