It took me few days to develop it, but it was in the background of my mind for more than a year.
I'm happy that this long evolving idea for my personal website is finally online.


I wanted to build a website without any image in the structure and that will be generate randomly, so it will surprise even me when I visit it.

After few tries, I found that complete randomness is equal to chaos and doesn't look good most of the time.

So I set the background blocks in matrix to keep them in order, defined few appearance animations and color themes and let the Javascript to choose one of them :)

It is generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][github_pages].
Here is a link to the [source code][source_code], if anyone is interested.
