It took me just few days to develop it, but it was on my mind for more than a year.
I'm happy that this long-evolving idea for my personal website is finally online.

I wanted to build a website that would be generated randomly, so it will surprise even me when I visit it.

After few attempts, I found that complete randomness is equal to chaos and doesn't look good most of the time.

So I set the background blocks in a matrix to keep them in order, I defined few appearance animations and color themes, and let the Javascript choose one of them :)

It is generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][github_pages].
Here is a link to the [source code][source_code], if anyone is interested.
