The title of this post may sound a bit strange to someone who is not used to be late 
(or to someone from the well-tuned countries :)

I had this bad habit for many years and I was surprised how simple the solution was. 
Yes, you read this from a person who used to be late on most informal meetings. 

Once, one of my close friends calculated how much time he spent waiting for me in the past 10 years. Honestly, I felt ashamed and guilty.

I'm very thankful to everyone who kept me aware and addressed this problem to me.

Now, with all daily obligations when I need to plan my time few days upfront, every hour is important.
The formula that works for me is pretty simple: **subtract the time you need - to prepare and get somewhere - from the meeting time**.

For example, you should be somewhere at 12:00 and you need 20 minutes to prepare, 20 minutes to get there, 10 minutes to find parking spot, and 10 extra minutes for contingencies. Then you should set 11:00 in your mind as the time you need to start preparing and 11:20 as time when you need to get out from home. Every minute after that increases the probability for being late. 

That's all, hope someone finds this advice useful. Use your time wisely, it is moving fast-forward.

*What you read above is not a rule, but a reminder of something that we should all be aware of; 
Something I've drawn out from my personal experience and I like to share with you.*
